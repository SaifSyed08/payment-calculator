## How to Embed This Widget Anywhere

### **⭐ Option 1: JavaScript Widget (Easiest)**
Embed the calculator anywhere with just two lines of code:
```html
<div id="payment-widget"></div>
<script src="https://saifsyed08.github.io/payment-calculator/widget.js"></script>
```
### **Option 2: iFrame Embed**
If your site blocks external scripts, you can use this method instead:
```html
<iframe
  src="https://saifsyed08.github.io/payment-calculator/"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  style="border:none; border-radius:10px;"
  loading="lazy"
></iframe>
```

### **Option 3: Copy & Paste the Code Directly**

You can also add the full calculator HTML directly to your own webpage.
Just paste the raw code from index.html
 into your site’s HTML editor. 

⭐ Note: This option allows for full customization, which is ideal if you want to make any style or layout edits to fit your website overall.
